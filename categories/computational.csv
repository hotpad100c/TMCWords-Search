,(Shulker Box) Disk Driver,,,,盒子硬盘,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,(Shulker Box) Disk Driver,
,AND-Gate,,,,与门,与门。一种逻辑电路，输出仅在所有输入均为真时为真。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Puerta AND,
,Decoder,"In computational redstone, it's sometimes used to mean increasing the size of a base, bin to hex, for example, see Transcoder.",,,解码器,在计算红石中，有时指增大编码基数，例如从二进制（bin）转换为十六进制（hex），参见转码器（Transcoder）。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Decodificador,
,Encoder,"In computational redstone, this sometimes refers to decreasing the size of the base used in the code: for example hex to bin. see Transcoder.",,,编码器,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Codificador,
,Fifo (aka Shift Register),,,,移位寄存器,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Registro de Desplazamiento,
,Logical Gate,,,,逻辑门,一种逻辑运算单元，在minecraft中，其有信号，无信号可以分别代表逻辑上个“真”搭“假”或二进制当中个1搭0，从而实现逻辑运算。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Puerta Lógica,
,Parallel Codes,"A code is said to be parallel if the all the bits of the signal are sent through individual wires or lines This usually allows for faster and easier to use codes than Serial codes, but it tends to be more expensive and bigger.",,,并行码/并行信号,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Código en Paralelo,
RAM,Random-Access Memory,,,,读写存储器,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Memoria de Acceso Aleatorio,
ROM,Read-Only Memory,,,,只读存储器,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Memoria de solo lectura,
,Redcoder,,,,红石信号解码器,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Redcoder,
,Serial Codes,"A code is said to be serial if the bits of the signal are sent one after the other through a single wire. This is more space and resource efficient than Parallel codes, but usually slower and harder to implement.",,,串行码/并行信号,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Código Serial,
,Shift Register (aka Fifo),,,,移位寄存器,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Registro de Desplazamiento,
,T Flip-Flop,Short for Toggle Flip-Flop. Refers a circuit that changes its output state (toggles) when a pulse is received.,,,T触发器/T触,一个装置，受到一次脉冲时翻转自身状态。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,T Flip-Flop,
,Toggle State,"Usually used to refer to intentionally having sticky piston's drop its block by sending it a <3gt pulse in order to cycle between two different states (toggling between block in and out). Importantly, togglestates have no default position, and there is no way to reset them. This makes them painful to use in survival as they're hard to debug. This is different to latches, which are also systems that hold state. Latches usually have a reset signal that you can trigger when something goes wrong.",,,T触*,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Toggle State (Estados alternos),
,Transcoder,"A device or contraption to convert between encodings of a signal: Binary to Hexadecimal, hex to octal, pulse length to binary, block event delay to overloaded comparator, etc.",,,转码器,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Transcodificador,
