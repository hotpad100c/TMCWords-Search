,Cast (Update) Suppression (aka CCE Suppression/Shulker Suppression) ,"Refers to a type of update suppression/suppressor based on CCE that is state-less and does not require reset, broken in ≥1.20.2. This can be achieved by using Tile Entity Swap to make a shulker box have a tile entity that is not a container, and make a comparator read from the box. Updating the comparator (with Block Update or Comparator Update) will make the box attempt to treat the non-container tile entity as container tile entity to calculate output, which then throws a CCE. The suppressor can also be toggled by powering the comparator. ",,,强制类型转换更新抑制/强转更新抑制 ,指基于CCE的没有状态、不需要重置的更新抑制，在≥1.20.2已失效。如利用方块实体替换，让一个潜影盒拥有一个非容器的方块实体，并且让一个比较器读取潜影盒的输出。更新该比较器（以方块更新或比较器更新）会使潜影盒尝试将非容器方块实体当作容器方块实体计算输出，然后就抛CCE异常了。充能比较器可以开关该抑制器。,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

,Sound Suppression/Suppressor ,"A type of suppression that suppresses game events on a specific channel within a 16 block radius. Can be used for update suppression, block protection, and item shadowing. Works in version 1.20-1.21.0 but will break on reload before 1.20.2. Sound suppressors rely on a TES between a calibrated sculk sensor and another tile entity which has at least 4 orientations (sculk sensor data goes into other block entity). The data of the sculk sensor will still actively listen for game events, but when it detects one, it will attempt to set the block state “sculk sensor phase” to “cooldown”, which will cause an exception (IAE) because only sculk sensors have this block state.",,,声音抑制/抑制器 ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
